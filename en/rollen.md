## Admin

Admin also known as: King eitje. Full control over everything and the only one who has access to all the settingpages.

> Beware, you can't delete **Admins** from eitje. If you want to delete someone with this role, first de-activate the admin role for this teammember.

---

## Manager

A manager is the second best thing; it gives you the power to add/delete/edit teammembers and will give them control over the schedule and onboarding capabilities in eitje.

> Having **Manager** powers does not grant the right to do anything related to time tracking or contracts. We have seperate roles for these features.

---

## Approve leave requests

The name it quite self explainatory we believe.

---

## Contracts

This is the only role that will allow you to view, edit and update the contracts of your teammembers.


---

## Approve hours

Give your teammembers the power to approve and/or edit timecards. 


---

## Write teammember hours

Give teammembers the power to edit timecards.

> The timecards still need to be approved after this role updates a timecard.

---

## Financials

Export data and reveal the **Details** page. 


---

## Not on schedule

Working with eitje but don't want to appear on the schedule. Assign this role to exclude teammembers from the schedule.

# Financial report

You can easily get insights into the current turnover(R), labor costs($) and labor productivity(LP). This way you ensure that you quickly know whether you have done well for the day or spent too much money on labor costs. Once you have worked with this functionality for a while, the analysis will also allow you to see much faster at which moments and days you are scheduled too broadly.

In the **Schedule** and the **Overview** inside the hours will give insight into the financial report. However, you will see different numbers in both areas. The schedule is a forecast we expect on the amount of shifts and revenue from the past, while the overview will show you the realized result.

## Forecast in the schedule
On the schedule we will show you the budgetted situation. This means that we show you the calculated expectation based on the schedule. The forecast for your turnover is an avarage of the turnover for the past 4 weeks on the same day. For example: on a monday you will see the turnover as an avarage of the past four mondays.

## Actuals in the overview
On the overview page you will see your actuals. We calculate the excact amount of cost by the timecards which have been approved or checked-in at that moment. The turnover that's shown on this page is the actual turnover (excluding taxes) for that specific day. You can enter the turnover by clicking on the € sign at the bottom right.

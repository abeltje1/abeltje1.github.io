## Laborcost distribution

This will distirbute your laborcost over all of your revenuegroups. It is possible to update/create/delete revenuegroups on the bottom of the modal. In the end you should make sure that all of the sliders should present a value of 100%. This will assign all of the hours worked from the selected team to the concerned revenuegroup.


> **Example:** If team: Bar is set to 100% for the revenuegroup: Serivce, this will incorperate all of the hours from the Bar team and uses it for the calculation in the revenuegroup.

## Conversion factor for zero hours/hour/payroll contract

The gross salary of your teammembers isn't the amount it will cost you as employer. To include the employercharges you should update the conversion factor for all of the contract settings.

## Laborcosts target value

This setting is not mandatory for a correct calculation, but will help you nonetheless. It will color the laborcost sum in red when you have reached the treshold you have set. This will be a visual cue that you have spent more on laborcost then you wished.

## Different types

We offer three different types of surcharges:

* On a function: Consider an allowance for an incidental managerial role. This allowance can be granted on a timecard.
* In a specific timeframe: A surcharge that is automatically assigned to the time of work. For example, consider an additional payment for each person who works on a Sunday.
* On public holidays: This supplement is also automatically granted. Think of an allowance for everyone who works on Christmas Day.

## Contract types
You can choose from a number of different contract types. Below are the different types and associated details.

* **Zero hours contract:** Use a zero-hour contract for all part-timers with which you have not agreed a specific number of hours.
* **Fixes hours contract:** This contract type is for all employees with whom a fixed number of hours has been agreed. It does not matter whether they have permanent or temporary employment. You can still set this per contract when creating the contract. By creating a fixed-hours contracat, eitje will automatically keep track of the overtime balance for this teammember.
* **Freelance:** If you hire freelancers who work for you for a longer period. Is it useful to give them access to eitje and to create a contract. This way the costs that this team member entails will be neatly included in the calculations for the wage costs.
* **Payroll** Do you use payrolling? Then it is still useful to contract these team members in eitje. These team members are officially under contract with the payroller, but by also putting their information in eitje, the costs incurred by these team members are also included in the calculations for the wage costs.

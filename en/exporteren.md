# Export your data
We thrive to show your data in the most comprehensive form inside the browser, but we also understand the need to export your data out of our system. 

**Jump to**
* [Export your timecards](/en/exporteren?id=export-your-timecards)
* [Export laborcosts](/en/exporteren?id=export-laborcosts)
* [Export your teammembers](/en/exporteren?id=export-your-teammembers)

## Export your timecards

Once you have approved your timecards, you can easily export the data out of eitje. You do this by navigating to the **Hours > Details**. There are various options to choose from:

* **per teammember:** A comprehensive overview of all the timecards of your teammembers.
* **per day:** A simple overview of all timecards per day per teammember.
* **per team:** A overview of all timecards per team per day.
* **quick entry:** A easy way to export your data to insert manually in your payroll software.

> It is also possible to integrate eitje directly to your payroll software. For this we would like to refer you to our manuals with regard to Integrations.

## Export laborcosts
Exporting labor costs is the same as exporting the timecards from the example above. The only difference is that you select the button that says **Export laborcosts**. After that you need to select a period over which you would like to export the data.

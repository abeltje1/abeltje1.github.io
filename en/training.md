## Start a topic

For starters, its good to know that you can create a training by adding articles to a topic. This topic or subject is a bundling of questions and articles which we can present to your teamemmbers. In the manuals on the bottom of this page we will show you how to implement the training,. but for starters let's see how you can create a topic.

## Create a article

Now you've created your first topic it's time to create a article for the topic. This is even easier than creating a topic, you only need to insert a name and maybe add it directly to a topic.

**Pro tip:**
Articles who are not connected to a topic will be shown in the Other Articles list. Dit is a accumulation of all of your unconnected articles and are visisble for all teammembers of the venue. When you connect a article to a topic it will automatically only be visible for the teams who can see the topic.

## Adding articles to a topic

When creating a article you can easily select a topic, but if you did'nt do this. There are two ways to add a article to a topic. In the video below we will show you both ways.

**Pro tip for organisations:**
Did you know that you could add 1 article to multiple topics, or even add a topic to multiple venues. This way you can serve multiple venues with 1 article and 1 topic.

## Use PDF file as article

Did you already create a mindblowing manual and just want to use that? No problem, you can simply upload a PDF file and we will make sure your people will be able to open it directly on their phone inside our app.

## Adding quizzes

Creating a ton of topics and articles is great, but wouldn't you like to know if people actually know the information? Create quizes to test your people on their knowledge.

## Publishing your topics and doing a test run

When you create a topic or article it won't be published straight away. This will enable you to make sure the article is really ready before you publish it. Unpublished items are only visisble for teammembers who have the role: **manager**. 

Even after publishing we can imagine you ust want to know how it looks for a user. Don't worry, simply try the Test run functionality to see what a users sees.

## Activate your training

After creating the topics, articles and questions, it's about time to make sure the teammembers actually start their training. In eitje we have created three different training possibilities so you can decide per topic which training setup it needs

* **On a specific day of the employment**: Perfect to onboard new teammembers. Just select a number of date, for instance 1. Your new teammember will then be prompted on his first day to actually follow this training. 
* **Untill a specific date**: Use this option if the information is only needed untill or on a specific date. 
* **Training is always open**: Sometimes it just doesn't matter when people undergo the training, but you still want them to have the option to do it on their own terms. Just select the always open status and the teammembers can start training whenever they want.

## Prompt the training for a specific teammember

Do you want a specific teammember to undergo the training? You can easily push the training into a teammembers training flow. This is also a great option to use if you want a teammember to undergo the training for the second time.

## View analytics for your training

After you put all the sweat into your training program. It would be nice to see who actually finished the training. By checking the analytics we can show you excactly who scored what and how is still busy with their training.

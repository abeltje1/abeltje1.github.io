## Trade a shift

Are you scheduled but are you unable to work? Don't worry, you can easily trade your shift with a teammeber. There are two options for this:

* **Find a replacement:**  If you want someone to take over your shift, you can immediately ask your team members if they want to take over your shift.
* **Trade your shift:** Do you want to trade your shift with another shift of a team member? Then select the relevant shift from the schedule.


> Note: If your colleague has accepted the trade request, your manager must still approve the trade before it will be put in effect.

## Update your timecard

At the end of your shift, you can report your hours via the **Hours** tab. Here you can find all hours of yourself. Click on the blue shifts to adjust your hours.

**What do the different colors mean?**
* **Blue:** You haven't updated your timecard yet.
* **Orange:** Your timecard is updated, but has not been approved by a manager.
* **Green:** Your timecard is approved.
* **Purple:** You have taken time off.
* **Red:** You have been ill or have been on special leave.

## Insert availability

You can also share your availability with the planner through eitje. This allows you to express a preference for the days when you cannot work.

> Note: If you really need to have a day off, it is advised to create a leave request.

## Create a leave request

If you really cannot work for a day / period, it is smarter to create a leave request. This way you can be sure that when the manager approves your request, you are really free.

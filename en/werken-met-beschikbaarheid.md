# Working with availability

Your teammembers can indicate their preference using the availability feature. By managing the availability inside eitje, you will be able to create the schedule much faster.


## Insert availability
Team members can report their availability through the app and our website. They can indicate how many shifts they can work in a week and indicate their preference per day. In addition, they can also give a reason why they are unavailable on this day.

To specify their preference on a specific day, they have three options:
* Available for the whole day
* Unavailable for the whole day
* Unavailable in a specific timeslot

In the example below you see the screen that pops up if you want to adjust a day. Teammembers can of course only insert this for themselves, but if you have the role for **Manager** or **Admin** you can also adjust this for others. Simply just click on the day in the row of the teammember you would like to adjust.

## Automate your availability

Your teammembers can automate their availability by creating a template. This way they don't need to insert their school and other returning activities every other week. They upload their schedule to the availability template and we paste this in every other week. Just as above: the role for **Manager** or **Admin** can also adjust this for others. Simply click on the 7 dots on the right side of the row.

## Closing the availability

You can also close the option to insert availability for a specific day. Below today's date in the schedule, you will see a blue check mark with the text "Availability open". By unchecking the box the availability for this day will close. In addition, you can also automatically turn off all days when the timetable is published. If the tick is unchecked, teammembers will no longer be able to adjust their availability, as a manager you can of course still do this.

> If there is no checkbox below today's date you have closed this automatically by the settings. For more information read about [the availability settings in eitje](/en/werken-met-beschikbaarheid?id=a-deeper-look-into-the-availability-settings)

## Automatic lock availability when treshold is reached

To ensure that you always have enough available teammembers at your disposal, you can put an automatic lock on availability. For example, eitje will automatically close a day for a particular team when the limit of the number of unavailable team members is reached. This is most easily set by using the default value for the automatic lock. You will see that these values ​​are used every week. However, if there is a special day, you can always change this on the specific date, so this will not conflict with the default value.

## A deeper look into the availability settings

If you have the role: **Admin**, you can adjust the settings in eitje. Below we look at all the different settings for the availability

* **Mandatory reason**: Activating this setting forces team members to provide a reason if they report themselves unavailable.
* **Close availability**: If you do wish for teammembers to report themselves unavailable and keep this in-house, you only need to activate this setting. This will disable all availability features in eitje.
* **Close availability in future**: You determine the number of days that availability closes in advance. This means that employees cannot adjust their availability at the last minute. If this date is for example 7 days, the availability will no longer be adjustable for the next 7 days. This also ensures that the check mark disappears in the planning and is only visible again on day 8 from now on.

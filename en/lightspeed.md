# Lightspeed integration

Automatically and with no sweat import your revenue data from Lightspeed. Every thirty minutes eitje will fetch your actual revenue from your Lightspeed POS. By enabling this integration you will never ever have to insert revenue by hand and will be able to track your laborcosts during the day.

To activate the Lightspeed integration navigate towards: **Settings > Company settings > POS integration > Lightspeed**. Simply login with your Lightspeed credentials and we will do the rest. 

**Important: After the integration is succesfull you will need to navigate towards the POS integration pop-up one more time to hook your LS floors to the revenuegroups in eitje. [More about working with revenuegroups and laborcost distribution](/en/instellingen?id=laborcost-distribution)**


> **This integration will add â‚¬10,- to your invoice on a monthly basis.**

## Approve a request
If a teammember has created a leave request, you will have to approve this as a manager. When approving leave, eitje gives different types of information per type of contract and your settings. In addition, there are a number of different fields that you can use:

* **Hours on contract in period:** The number of contract hours your team member should work in the period of the request.
* **Current leave balance:** The current amount of leave for the teammember
* **Current overtime balance:** The current amount of overtime for the teammember
* **Amount of hours:** The amount of hours and minutes you would like to take out of the leave balance for this leave request.
* **Leave balance on end of contract/year:** This shows the expected leave balance for this teammember at the end of the year/contract.

This ensures that everything that was changed because of the approval will be removed and you can start over.

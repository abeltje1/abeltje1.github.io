## Create multiple shifts

Congrats, you have succesfully created your first shift. Altough, wouldn't it be nice if you can create multiple shifts at the same time? 

Just open the modal for a new shift and select multiple days, or create copies of the one you are already making.

## Drag and Drop scheduling

Created all of your shifts? Now it's time to start scheduling your teammembers. You can do this by drag & drop if you ticked the box that says **Availability** right next to your teamfilter. All of your available teammembers will appear below the shift and you can just drag them onto their shift.

## Order your teams

Now you've scheduled your first teammembers, you suddenly realise the order of the teams is completely off with your wishes. Don't worry; by clicking **Tools > Manage teams** you can select which teams you want to see on the schedule and you can even order them in the right order.

## Publish your first schedule

Allright, all of your shifts are created and your teammembers are scheduled. It is time to publish the shifts to your teammembers. You'll notice that every shift has a little red cirle with a **p** inside it. This means the shift still needs to be published. You can publish a shift one-by-one or by clicking the **Publish** button on the right-top side. 

> Open shifts will also be published. These will be presented to your teammembers as a trade request. This way you can easily let your teammembers fill in the gaps.

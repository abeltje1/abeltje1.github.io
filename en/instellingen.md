## Mandatory reason when unavailable
With this setting you can oblige your employees to always fill in a reason when updating their availability.

---

## Close availability for all teammembers
Do you not want employees to be able to fill in their availability and do you manage this for them yourself? No problem, with this setting you can switch off the entire availability for your team members. Only the people with a Manager role can then adjust the availability via the web platform.

If you do not wish to use our availability features. Simply swipe the switch off and they will disappear for your teammembers. 

> Only teammembers with the role: **Manager** will still be able to change the availability for your teammembers on the website.

---


## Close availability ahead in future
With this field you indicate how many days in advance the availability automatically closes.

> Example: Today is January 1. If you set this setting at 7 days, the availability will automatically close until January 8th.

---

## Activate hour registration

Do you want to activate time tracking in eitje? Turn on the switch and all the options will appear.


---

## Write your own hours

This setting is enabled by default when activating time tracking. This ensures that your teammembers can change their hours after their shift.. When turned off, your team will not be able to update their hours and only the teammembers with the role: **Write teammember hours/Approve hours** will be able to update the hours for the employees. 

---

## Update hours before

If teammembers can update their time after their shift, this setting will determine the timeframe for this action. 

---

## Startdate of hour registration

Define from which date you want to start creating timecards. 

> This date should align with the startdate of your wage period.

---

## New day start

Defines the time at which a new day starts. At this time we will automatically sign-out everyone who forgot to clock-out.

---


## Meal allowance

Track the meals of your teammembers. You simply have to activate it. All activated meals are reflected in the schedule & time tracking for your teammembers. Under Hours> Details, you can see the amount of meals a teammember consumed in the given timeframe.

---


## Activate HR integration

We offer various integrations with HR Partners. By integrating eitje with your HR partner you can create a simpler HR process. See our partner page on the website if we have an integration with your partner: https://eitje.app/partners.

---

## Laborcost distribution

This will distirbute your laborcost over all of your revenuegroups. It is possible to update/create/delete revenuegroups on the bottom of the modal. In the end you should make sure that all of the sliders should present a value of 100%. This will assign all of the hours worked from the selected team to the concerned revenuegroup.


> **Example:** If team: Bar is set to 100% for the revenuegroup: Serivce, this will incorperate all of the hours from the Bar team and uses it for the calculation in the revenuegroup. 

---

## Laborcosts target value

This setting is not mandatory for a correct calculation, but will help you nonetheless. It will color the laborcost sum in red when you have reached the treshold you have set. This will be a visual cue that you have spent more on laborcost then you wished.

## Teamchat

eitje offers teamchat directly inside our app. This is often used for passing on short updates for the transfer of shifts, reporting certain issues and short questions.

## News updates

Often enough things happen that are very important for your team members. Unfortunately, it's a pain in the ass to scroll back inside chatgroups. That is why you have your own timeline inside eitje full of important news updates. Creating a news item is very easy and fast. Once posted, all team members of the specific team will receive a push notification.

## Extra features inside our app

Since you will probably open the app a lot more often than the web platform, we have put some nice extras in the app for the managers.

* **Read receipts:** You can see exactly who has read a news item in the app by opening the message and clicking the blue round buttons. This button allows you to open the message statistics.

* **Send reminders:** Once you have arrived at the statistics, you can see exactly who and when someone has read the message. If the message has not been read, you can send a quick reminder.

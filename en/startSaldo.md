# Starting the balance sheet
Keeping track of the balancesheets of your employees, isn't the most fun part of your job. That's why we created our tools as convenient and easy as possbile, this way even this job barely takes your time. In this manual we will take a look at how you can easily setup your balance for the overtime and leave registration.

* [Insert startvalues](/en/startSaldo?id=insert-startvalues)
* [Final check](/en/startSaldo?id=final-check)


## Contract settings
Should a zero hour contract build up leave and if so, how much should it build per worked hour. It is very important that eitje has the right settings so it can calculate the right amount of leave for your teammembers. So which settings should you check and where can you find them?
* Zero hour contracts 
* Fixed hour contract

> Both settings can be found by navigating towards **Settings > Company Settings > Contracts**

## Balance startdate
It is of course possible that you start with eitje in the middle of the year. This means all of your team members have already built up their leavebalance and probably have a negative/positive value on their overtime. To ensure that you can start with the correct numbers, it is important to select a start date for the balance. This ensures that the balance is only built up or deducted from the date you entered. 

**Note:** Having a hard time figuring out your startdate? This is 99 out of 100 times the date you officialy started timetracking in eitje.

## Insert start values
In order to ensure that your teammembers start with the correct values, you should set their current values for the balance startdate. You can easily do this by navigating towards **Hours > Balance** and hitting the button that says **Start balance**. This opens up a modal where you can adjust the balance startdate and enter all of the start values for your teammembers.

> Do make sure you have all of your teammembers contracts sorted. [More about contracts](/en/contracten)

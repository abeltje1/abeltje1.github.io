## Saving a template
You can easily create a template from your schedule. In this manual we first look at how to save a template, after that you can easily create multiple templates. 


> It is useful to know that eitje always saves every shift in teams you select while saving your template. So think carefully about which teams you select when saving.

## Loading a template

Once you have saved a template you can easily load this template. When loading a template you always have two options:

* **Without team members:** All shifts will be inserted as open shifts
* **With team members:** Teammembers who are saved in the template will be scheduled


> In the example below we will insert a template with teammembers.

## Schedule unavailabe teammembers

Your team members can indicate their availability, but that does not mean that they can no longer be scheduled. By clicking on the shift and under **Scheduled for** you can see all people who are available/unavailable. By simply selecting the unavailable teammember you can still schedule this person. If there is a conflict between the availability and the shift of a team member, the shift will automatically light up red.

## Exporting the schedule

Did you knew that you can easily export the schedule to a Excel file. This enables you to print the schedule with just a few clicks. You can export the schedule in two different views.

* **Table view**:  Show all shifts with the days on top and the teammembers on the left side. This gives you all of the shifts of one teammembers side by side.
* **List view**: Show all shifts on a day underneath eachother sorted on time. This export also includes a little bit more information like the note that's added to a shift.

## More companies in one overview

Are you part of several companies in an organization. Then you can also display all schedules in one overview. You do this by selecting all desired locations in the dropdown.

## Tracking the number of shifts

When planning, numbers are displayed among your team members. Here you can see two different numbers:

* **In a shift:** The scheduled shift number represents the number of times this team member has been scheduled in the current week.
* **In availability card:** The number in the availability card indicates the number of shifts this team member wants to work in this week.

> It could be that you see amount of contract hours for a team member. You get this by creating a contract in his profile.

The easy thing about scheduling with eitje is that these numbers are continuously up to date. This way you know exactly how many times you can still schedule a teammember in the current week. Of course you can also schedule a teammember more often than he has indicated to be able to work. The number will then go below zero.

> If a team member has not provided an amount of shifts and has no hour contract, the number of available shifts will be set to two by default.

## Publish your open shifts

Can't fill in all shifts? Don't worry, simply publish the open shift and it will be sent to all of the members of this specific team. From there, your team members can apply to work this shift.

> Tip: Leave a note with a shift. This will be incorperated in your shift requests and will impact the response ratio.

## Empty your week

Want to start over? Just click **Tools > Clear Week**, you'll be asked which teams you would like to clear.

## Working with the team panel

In the team panel you have two functionalities:

* **Contract hours** Displays how many hours everyone is scheduled in the current week. Here you can filter by different contract types, or just display everyone.
* **Sick** Report your team member sick. This will add a sick emoticon to the teammember.

## Creating events

It occasionally happens that there's something special on the agenda. A party, birthday, training, meeting or an important game of your favorite club. You can easily communicate this to your team members by creating an Event. These will show on the schedule and easily pop out so that team members won't miss them. 

> Note: Unlike shifts; you don't have to publish an event. This happens automatically when you press OK.

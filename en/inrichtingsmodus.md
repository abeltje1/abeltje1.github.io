# Stealth mode

If you are just starting with eitje, your account is always in stealth mode. This means that you can start working in peace, without informing your teammembers. For example, no emails will be sent when inviting new team members or when the planning is published.

## What is this

Chances are that you just want to experience eitje without all your team members being informed and receiving e-mails. We have developed the onboarding mode for this. This way you can setup your establishment in eitje and you only have to inform your team members when you are ready for the real thing.

## Setting up your environment

If you log in to the web version of eitje, as long as your in stealth mode your first aid helper will open up on the left side of your screen. This is a short introduction of 6 different steps to set up your environment. Per part there are max. 3 steps to perform. By clicking on the parts you will get videos and manuals on how to go through these steps.


> All in all you can go through all these steps in less than an hour and be done with your setup.

## Deactivate stealth mode

Done and ready to give your team members access to eitje? Open the first aid by onboarding helper and switch off the stealth mode on the bottom of the page. At this point, a button will appear on your **Teammembers** page that will allow you to invite all team members at once.

By pressing this button all team members will receive an email from eitje to help activate their account. Also, from now on, when the schedule is published or a new team member is added, an e-mail will be sent automatically.

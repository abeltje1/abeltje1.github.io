## The fundamentals

What exactly is the difference between overtime and your leave balance?

**Overtime:** is important for employees with a fixed hours contract. Their contract states they should work an X number of hours in the week. By tracking the hours in an eitje, you can see exactly whether someone has worked more or less than her contract. If someone does not work enough in one period, this will result in a negative balance for this team member.

**Leave**: The leave balance keeps track of the amount of leave hours a teammember has gathered. A teammember amasses leave by his contract. Everyday it will increase a little bit and will decrease when a timecard uses the type: Leave. In contrast to the overtime balance, this has nothing to do with the number of hours worked. 


## Current balance

By navigating to Hours > Balance you'll open the balance sheet of your team. The top graph always represents the current value of today. 

* **Red:** Represents a negative value.
* **Blue:** Represents a positive value.

## Balance in a specific timeframe

Most of the time when looking at the balancesheet you would like to see what happened over a longer timeframe. That's why on the bottom of the page you can select a period. This will gather all data in this specific timeframe and will show you exactly what happened from the start of the period till the end of the selected period.

You can make adjustments to the balance of your team member. You can open this screen by hovering your mouse over the column of adjustments for the relevant team member. In the pop-up you will be asked to insert a date, influence the number of hours positively or negatively and add a comment.

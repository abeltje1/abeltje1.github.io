## Laborcost per teammember
* Laborcosts per hour = Gross salary  *  Conversion factor

## Laborcost per teammember including allowances

In case of a specific allowance, the laborcost will inrease on those specific hours/days. This will change the calculation: **Laborcosts per hour = Gross salary  *  Conversion factor  *  Allowance factor**

Allowance factor is combined of the following data:
* **Allowance factor** = Overlap  *  Allowance weight
* **Overlap** = The amount of time the allowance is active on the shift (if overlap is 100% the overlap factor will be 1)
* **Allowance weight** = The amount of allowance that is set in the settings (1.5 if setting is 50%)

## Labor productivity 
The Labor productivity is used to define how much revenue is obtained for every hour worked. This is a simple calculation and will divide the revenue by the total amount of hours. 

**Revenue / Amount of hours**

> Example:
On a day you had €2.000,- of revenue. In total your teammembers worked for 40 hours. This will result in a value of €50,- for your labor productivity (2000/40=50).

## Laborcosts in percentages
After calculating your laborcosts we can use that number to define the percentage of your laborcost in comparison to your revenue. 

**Revenue / Laborcosts of all teammembers combined  * 100**

# unTill integration

Automatically and with no sweat import your revenue data from unTill. Every thirty minutes eitje will fetch your actual revenue from your MPlus POS. By enabling this integration you will never ever have to insert revenue by hand and will be able to track your laborcosts during the day.

To activate the unTill integration navigate towards: **Settings > Company settings > POS integration > unTill**. Simply login with your unTill credentials and we will do the rest. 

> **Contact your POS distributor to find your credentials.**

**Important: After the integration is succesfull you will need to navigate towards the POS integration pop-up one more time to hook your product categories to the revenuegroups in eitje.
